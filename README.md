# Cryptid-Sledgfire-Pump-Action-Clip-Fed-Conversion
It's a 3D printed conversion that turns the sledgefire into a pump action clip fed shotgun.
My printer isn't the most calibrated so some parts may be lose and require adjustment. 
The fusion file has all the hardware diameters listed as parameters so they can be easily adjusted.
